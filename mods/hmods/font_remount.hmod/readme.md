This module will search **/media/hakchi/fonts** and **/var/lib/hakchi/fonts** for font files with the following names

- title.fnt
- copyright.fnt
- debug.fnt
- small.fnt
- medium.fnt
- large.fnt

It comes with an extended title.fnt by default and will use that if no other is specified.

A description of the font files is as follows:

**title.fnt**  
This is the game title font

**copyright.fnt**  
This is used on the legal screen.

**small.fnt**  
This is used for the button legend and in tooltips.

**medium.fnt**  
This is used all over the UI.

**large.fnt**  
This is used for menu headings.
