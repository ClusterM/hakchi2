=== SNES Custom Filter BWT - Controller handled filters by Bewildered Thetan ===

This module allows you to tweak video filters on SNES Mini or Super Famicom Mini (yes, only SNES, not NES/Famicom) by using
your controller in port 1.

DISCLAIMER:
Use this mod at your own risk. It has been thoroughly tested on an SNES Mini European edition, but that doesn't mean
it couldn't have overlooked side-effects. If you brick your console, don't complain about it. Chances are high that
people can help you out, but don't necessarily count on that.
Do NOT install this mod if you do not agree with this disclaimer!!

Usage:

- Load a game normally and the filter settings you configured in the SNES Classic menu are used.
- Load a game while holding the LB (left bumper) and RB (right bumper) buttons to load a configurations menu where you can tweak the filters
  - If the menu says something like AAA, it means press A three times
  - Press START to apply the settings for the loaded game

When holding the RB button while loading a game (or after applying the settings in the tweak filters menu by loading the game by holding LB and RB),
the filter settings are saved (settings are stored per game!)

When holding the LB button while loading a game, saved filter settings for the game are used, in case they are saved. If there are no settings saved,
the settings from the SNES Classic menu are used.
  
For your information, the SNES Classic menu settings translate to the following settings:

CRT Filter    -> post-process filter Scanlines, magnification filter Linear
4:3           -> post-process filter OpenGL, magnification filter AntiAliasedNearest
Pixel-perfect -> post-process filter OpenGL, NO magnification filter and pixel-perfect mode enabled

With these three possibilities, you could not use the CRT Filter settings combined with pixel-perfect mode, but with this mod you can. With this mod you can make any
combination you like, so have fun with it!

TIP: The settings also work when loading a suspend point/save game!

WARNING: this mod can conflict with other mods! You can install the snes_custom_filters mod, but this mod will override it.
When uninstalling this mod when the snes_custom_filters mod is also installed will make the snes_custom_filters mod active again, so they do not interfere.

Good luck and have fun with this mod.
