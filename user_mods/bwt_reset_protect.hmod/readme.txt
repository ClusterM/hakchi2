=== BWT Factor reset protection mod by Bewildered Thetan ===

This mod protects the factor reset functionality of the SNES Classic Mini with a code.

NOTE: This mod needs the BWT Code Protector hmod to be installed! If not, you will get an error
when executing the factory reset, but the factory reset will NOT be executed (to be safe).

When you try to perform a factory reset (by clicking the Reset button, so AFTER the progressbar is filled on the 'Reset to factory settings' button),
you will be presented with a screen where you have to enter the correct code for factory reset.
If no code has been set initially, you will need to enter a code first. Note that button presses, as well as releases are registered as code
characters and you can use all buttons (controller 1 only). Directional buttons are not supported and the START button confirms the code.
So, you can do this for instance: hold button A, press B, press X, release button A
The code you enter has no limit, so you can make it as long as you want.

DISCLAIMER:
Use this mod at your own risk. It has been thoroughly tested on an SNES Mini European edition, but that doesn't mean
it couldn't have overlooked side-effects. If you brick your console, don't complain about it. Chances are high that
people can help you out, but don't necessarily count on that.
Do NOT install this mod if you do not agree with this disclaimer!!

USAGE:
Just install it and try to perform a factory reset via the Options menu.
  
Good luck and have fun with this mod.
