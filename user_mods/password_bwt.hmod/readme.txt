=== Password Protection Hack v2 by Bewildered Thetan ===

This module adds code protection to SNES Mini.
It has only been tested on an SNES Mini European Edition!
Original mod code written by (Clusterrr?) was used as a source of information for writing this.

DISCLAIMER:
Use this mod at your own risk. It has been thoroughly tested on an SNES Mini European edition, but that doesn't mean
it couldn't have overlooked side-effects. If you brick your console, don't complain about it. Chances are high that
people can help you out, but don't necessarily count on that.
Do NOT install this mod if you do not agree with this disclaimer!!

USAGE:
This mod can be installed together with the original Password Protection Hack. In this situation, the original
mod is ran first and then this mod. This way you can add an extra password level :-)

Using this module you can do the following (using controller 1)

- Set a master code (to be able to change a access code)
- Set an access code (to access the system)
- Change the access code by entering the master code
- Login using the access code
- Disable the mod using a preprogrammed code
  This code can only be set once and you will be asked to define it upon first boot after mod installment.
  Do NOT lose this code, as it's the only way to disable the mod in case you forgot the master code AND the
  access code. Well, you can always uninstall the mod using Hakchi2 of course, but that can be annoying if you have the
  system somewhere with you where Hakchi2 is not available (on holiday for instance ;-))
- Enable the mod when disabled by holding the LB (left bumper) and RB (right bumper) buttons during boot time of the script until the screen
  pops up that lets you set the master code and access code again (they are reset in this situation).

Both button presses and releases are registered, so you could enter a code like: 
press A, press and release B, press and release X, release A
All buttons apart from the START button are supported. The START button is used to confirm the inputted code.
NOTE: Directional button presses are NOT supported (because of the way the controller is read, the 'easy' way),
so for example: LEFT/UP might be registered as a LEFT, or a UP press, depending on how you pressed it.
So, just stick to the buttons A,B,X,Y,LB,RB,UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT and SELECT
 
When booting the system after installing this mod it will prompt you for setting the master and access code.
After this step, when rebooting the system the mod will ask for your access code.
If you enter the master code, you are entering the stage to change the access code.
When entering the access code, the system boots up.

You can enter an incorrect code three times, after which you can only power-off the system using the POWER switch (you can also power the
system off by unplugging the power-cable, but that's not really recommended)
Obviously the retry counter is reset upon reboot.

Don't worry if you don't understand how to use it. You will be guided through the whole process with
informational screens in English, which state what to do.

Good luck and have fun with this mod.
