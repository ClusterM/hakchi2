=== Canoe Save State Compression by CompCom ===

This is an experimental mod for compressing save states generated by the canoe emulator on the SNES mini.
The mod supports the execution of both compressed and uncompressed saves. This script uses p7zip (http://sourceforge.net/projects/p7zip/) to compress the rollback folder generated when the canoe emulator is closed.

Known Issues:
Mod needs to be reinstalled after every game sync (due to hakchi script auto update).
This mod currently breaks compatibility with the "My Game Play Demo" feature (it is recommended you disable this feature).
Uninstalling this mod does not decompress your saves. It is recommended that users testing this mod know how to decompress their saves manually.

As this mod is still experimental you agree to use the mod at your own risk and that I am not responsible for any issues, damages, errors, loss of saves .etc.
*** Backup your save states before using this mod. ***
