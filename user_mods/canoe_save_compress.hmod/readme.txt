=== Canoe Save State Compression by CompCom ===

This is an experimental mod for compressing save states generated by the canoe emulator on the SNES mini.
This script uses p7zip (http://sourceforge.net/projects/p7zip/) to compress save states.

Known Issues:
Uninstalling this mod does not decompress your saves. It is recommended that users testing this mod know how to decompress their saves manually.

As this mod is still experimental you agree to use the mod at your own risk and that I am not responsible for any issues, damages, errors, loss of saves.etc.
*** Backup your save states before using this mod. ***

Thanks to bewilderedthetan and Loafdude for their suggestions and discussion of compression implementation.
Extra thanks to Loafdude for game sync fix.
